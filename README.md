✅ 1. Problem Statement

Predict future sales using machine learning models based on factors like:

Advertising Spend (TV, Radio, Newspaper, etc.)

Target Segment

Platform (e.g., social media, TV, print)



---

🧹 2. Data Preparation

Dataset: If you don't have one, we can use the popular Advertising Dataset as an example.

Steps:

Load dataset using pandas

Check for nulls & duplicates

Encode categorical features (like platform or segment)

Normalize/scale features if needed



---

📊 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

Use matplotlib and seaborn to:

Plot correlation heatmap

Visualize how advertising spend affects sales

Segment-wise sales patterns



---

🔁 4. Model Building

Choose from:

Linear Regression – for basic insight

Random Forest Regressor – for non-linear relationships

Time Series (ARIMA, Prophet) – if date/time is involved



---

🔮 5. Sales Prediction

Train-test split (e.g., 80-20)

Evaluate model with:

R² Score

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)


Predict future sales



---

📈 6. Advertising Impact Analysis

Vary ad budget across platforms and observe prediction impact

Use partial dependence plots or feature importance



---

📌 7. Business Insights

Deliver marketing recommendations like:

"Increasing digital ad spend yields higher ROI"

"Target Segment B responds better to print ads"
